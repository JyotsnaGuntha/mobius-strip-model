# Mobius Strip Visualization and Analysis

## Overview

This project implements a parametric 3D model of a Mobius strip — a fascinating non-orientable surface with only one side and one edge. Using Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib, the code generates a mesh representation of the strip, calculates its approximate surface area, measures the edge length, and visualizes it in 3D.

This exploration blends geometry, numerical integration, and computer graphics to bring topology to life and demonstrates how computational methods can approximate complex shapes.

### How I Structured the Code

The program is organized around a `MobiusStrip` class that encapsulates all functionality:

- **Initialization:** Sets key parameters (radius, width, resolution) and generates parameter grids.
- **Mesh Computation:** The `_compute_mesh` method calculates 3D coordinates from parametric equations.
- **Surface Area Calculation:** Uses numerical gradients and vector cross products to approximate the surface area.
- **Edge Length Calculation:** Computes the length of the boundary by summing Euclidean distances between consecutive edge points.
- **Plotting:** Visualizes the Möbius strip using Matplotlib's 3D plotting capabilities.

### How I Approximated Surface Area

Surface area is approximated by numerically integrating the magnitude of the cross product of the partial derivatives of the surface with respect to the two parameters (u and v). These partial derivatives represent tangent vectors along the surface. The cross product magnitude at each mesh point corresponds to an infinitesimal surface element, and summing these over the mesh yields the total approximate area.

### Challenges Faced

- Accurately calculating numerical gradients on a discretized mesh while maintaining stability.
- Correctly encoding the Möbius strip’s twist in the parametric equations to ensure a seamless, one-sided surface.
- Choosing an appropriate mesh resolution to balance computational efficiency with accuracy and smooth visualization.
